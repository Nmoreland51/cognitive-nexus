## 📊 **Example Usage**

### **Comprehensive Web Research Example**
1. User enters: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence`
2. AI extracts:
   - **Main Page**: Complete Wikipedia article with all sections
   - **Linked Pages**: Related articles like "Machine Learning", "Neural Networks", etc.
   - **Structured Content**: Headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, links
   - **Comprehensive Analysis**: Content type, themes, insights
3. User sees:
   - Content breakdown by type (headings, paragraphs, lists, etc.)
   - Linked pages preview with summaries
   - Total pages discovered and processed
4. User saves to knowledge base
5. All pages (main + linked) immediately available in Chat

### **Intelligent Chat Synthesis Example**
1. User asks: "What is artificial intelligence and how does machine learning relate to it?"
2. AI searches saved knowledge and finds:
   - Main page: "Artificial Intelligence" 
   - Linked page: "Machine Learning"
   - Related information from both sources
3. AI responds with comprehensive synthesis:
   - **Comprehensive Analysis from 2 Sources**
   - **1. Artificial Intelligence**: Summary, insights, key facts
   - **2. Machine Learning**: Summary, insights, key facts  
   - **Related Information**: Shows how pages connect
   - **Synthesis**: Combines information for complete understanding
